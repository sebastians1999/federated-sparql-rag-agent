This was the first experiment I ever ran. It only focused on 6 sparql instances of the test set.
These instances were selected manually by focusing on compareable easy questions.
Furthermore the prompt was already somewhat advanced, since it already included a couple of steps how to build the query.
So this experiment was not a true test of the agent's capabilities as a baseline. 
However it already gave some indications what is going right and what is going wrong. 
These results were taken into account when constructing the sparql query construction prompt.
