# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql
# This query is a draft and may not return a complete human metabolome.
# It aims to retrieve information related to the human metabolome from UniProt.
# The definition of metabolome is broad, and this query may need refinement based on specific requirements.
