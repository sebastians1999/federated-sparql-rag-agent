      # You might need to adjust this part based on how "Japanese" relates to chemicals in the data.
      # This is a placeholder; replace with the appropriate relationship if available.
      # Example: Assuming there's a property linking chemicals to organisms/regions.
      ?chemical rdfs:label ?chemicalName . # Get the label of the chemical
      FILTER (REGEX(?chemicalName, "Japanese", "i")) # Filter for chemicals with "Japanese" in their name (case-insensitive)
    }

  # Attempt to translate the chemical name to English using ALLIE (if available).
  # This part assumes that there is a way to link to ALLIE or another translation service.
  # Since direct translation via SPARQL is not possible, this is a conceptual representation.
  # In reality, you would need to use an external service or a dataset containing translations.
  BIND(STR(?chemicalName) AS ?chemicalNameToTranslate) # Bind the chemical name to a variable

  # Placeholder for translation service.  This needs to be replaced with actual translation logic.
  # Example: If there were a property indicating the English translation:
  # ?chemical :englishTranslation ?englishTranslation .
  # Or, if there were a service to query:
  # SERVICE <http://example.org/translationService> {
  #   ?translationRequest :input ?chemicalNameToTranslate .
  #   ?translationRequest :output ?englishTranslation .
  # }

  # For now, just return the original chemical name as the "translation" if no translation service is available.
  BIND(?chemicalName AS ?englishTranslation) # If no translation is available, return the original name.
