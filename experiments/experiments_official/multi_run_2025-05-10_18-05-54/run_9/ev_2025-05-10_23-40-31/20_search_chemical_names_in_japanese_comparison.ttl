# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql
# Federated SPARQL query to search for chemical names starting with "Japanese" and translate them to English using Allie.
# Note: This query assumes that there is a service called "Allie" that can translate names.
#       Since there is no direct translation service available in the provided endpoints,
#       this query focuses on finding chemical entities related to "Japanese" and lists their names.
#       A real-world implementation would require integration with a translation API or service.

SELECT DISTINCT ?chemicalName
WHERE {
  # Find chemical entities with names starting with "Japanese" in ChEBI.
  SERVICE <https://sparql.rhea-db.org/sparql> {
    ?chemical a chebi:CHEBI_24431 .  # CHEBI_24431 represents chemical entities
    ?chemical rdfs:label ?chemicalName .
    FILTER STRSTARTS(LCASE(?chemicalName), "japanese")
  }
  
  # Ideally, a translation service would be used here to translate the chemicalName to English.
  # Since no such service is available in the provided endpoints, the query returns the original name.
  # Example of how a hypothetical translation service might be used:
  #   SERVICE <http://example.org/translationService> {
  #     ?translationService :translate ?chemicalName ;
  #                         :toLanguage "en" ;
  #                         :translatedName ?englishChemicalName .
  #   }
  #   BIND(?englishChemicalName AS ?translatedName)
  # In the absence of a translation service, we simply return the original name.
  # BIND(?chemicalName AS ?translatedName)
}
