# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql
# The user is asking to search for Japanese abbreviations and long forms in UniProt.
# Since ALLIE is an abbreviation/long form service, and the user wants to search UniProt using Japanese,
# this query will focus on finding UniProt entries that might have Japanese-related information.
# However, without a direct link between ALLIE and UniProt in the provided context,
# the query will primarily search UniProt for entries associated with "Japanese" as a keyword or organism.
# Further refinement would be needed if ALLIE data were directly accessible via a SPARQL endpoint or API.
