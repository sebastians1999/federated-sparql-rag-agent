      # You might need to adjust this part based on how "Japanese" relates to chemicals in the data.
      # This is a placeholder; replace with the appropriate relationship.
      # Example: Assuming there's a property linking chemicals to a taxonomy or origin.
      ?chemical rdfs:label ?chemicalName . # Assuming chemicals have a label.
      FILTER (CONTAINS(LCASE(?chemicalName), "japanese")) # Filter for chemicals with "japanese" in their name.

  # Attempting to translate the chemical name to English using ALLIE.
  # Note: ALLIE translation is not directly available in standard SPARQL endpoints.
  # This part is speculative and assumes an external service or data source for translation.
  # You would need to replace this with a call to a translation service or a lookup in a translation dataset.
  # Example (Hypothetical):
  # SERVICE <http://example.org/allie-translation-service> { # Replace with actual translation service endpoint.
  #   ?translationRequest a <http://example.org/TranslationRequest> .
  #   ?translationRequest <http://example.org/sourceText> ?chemicalName .
  #   ?translationRequest <http://example.org/targetLanguage> "en" .
  #   ?translationRequest <http://example.org/translatedText> ?englishTranslation .
  # }

  # Since direct translation is not possible, this query will only retrieve chemical names containing "Japanese".
  BIND (?chemicalName AS ?englishTranslation) # Placeholder:  Without a translation service, the original name is used.
