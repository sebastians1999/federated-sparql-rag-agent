# Natural Language Question
# =======================
Connect patents cited in UniProtKB with those in the patent database at EPO via publication number, whose grant date is more than twenty years in the past.

# Target Endpoint
# ===============
https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql/

# Ground Truth Query
# =================
PREFIX patent: <http://data.epo.org/linked-data/def/patent/>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX up: <http://purl.uniprot.org/core/>

# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql
# This query retrieves patent identifiers from UniProtKB. Since there is no EPO endpoint available, the connection and date filtering cannot be performed.
SELECT DISTINCT ?patent
WHERE {
  SERVICE <https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql> {
    ?protein a uniprot:Protein .
    ?protein rdfs:seeAlso ?patent . # Assuming rdfs:seeAlso links to external resources like patents.  Adjust if the actual property is different.
    FILTER CONTAINS(STR(?patent), "patent") # Filter to only include resources that contain the word "patent" for simplicity. Adapt based on actual URI patterns.
