# Natural Language Question
# =======================
Connect patents cited in UniProtKB with those in the patent database at EPO via publication number, whose grant date is more than twenty years in the past.

  # However, no SPARQL endpoint for a "patent database at EPO" was provided in the context.
  # Therefore, this query retrieves patent information that UniProtKB *itself* holds for its entries
  # and filters based on the date criteria, but cannot perform a federation step to an external EPO database as requested.
