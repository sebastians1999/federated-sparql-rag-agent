# Query 12
# Select all Rhea reactions used to annotate enzyme sequences in UniProtKB
# return the number of UniProtKB entries
# Federated query using a service to UniProt SPARQL endpoint
#
# This query corresponds to the Rhea website query:

             # This property is typically used for enzymes.
             # Note: Linking transporters directly to Rhea reactions via a standard property
             # might not be as common unless the transport involves a chemical reaction
             # captured in Rhea and linked via up:catalyzedReaction.

  }
  # No need to query the Rhea service explicitly just to select the reaction URI,
  # as the URI is already obtained from the UniProt service via up:catalyzedReaction.
