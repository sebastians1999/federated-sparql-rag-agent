# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql
# The user is asking to generate a draft human metabolome. This is a broad request, so I will focus on retrieving a list of metabolites associated with human proteins.
# I will start by querying UniProt for human proteins and then attempt to link these proteins to metabolites via Rhea reactions.
# Finally, query SwissLipids to include lipid information.
