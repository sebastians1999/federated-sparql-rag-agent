# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.rhea-db.org/sparql
# This query aims to find the distribution of reactions based on the first level of enzyme classification.
# It assumes that there is a way to link reactions to enzyme classifications, possibly through Rhea's data model.
# However, without specific details on how enzyme classifications are represented in Rhea, the query is based on general assumptions.

    ?reaction rhea:ec ?enzymeClass . # Assuming rhea:ec links to enzyme classification.  This is a guess.

    # Further filtering or processing of enzymeClass to get the "first level" might be needed here,
    # depending on how the EC numbers are structured.  For example, if EC numbers are strings like "1.2.3.4",
    # you might need to extract the first digit.  This is not implemented here due to lack of specific schema information.
