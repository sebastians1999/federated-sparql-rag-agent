# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql
# The user is asking to use ALLIE service to search for abbreviations/long forms in Japanese and English, then use the results to query UniProt.
# Since I cannot directly interact with the ALLIE service, I will construct a SPARQL query that assumes the user has already obtained the relevant terms (either abbreviations or long forms) from ALLIE related to UniProt entries.
# This query will search UniProt for entries that contain either the abbreviation or the long form in their description or other relevant fields.
# Note: This is a simplified approach due to the inability to directly interface with the ALLIE service. A more complete solution would involve an external script to query ALLIE and then construct the SPARQL query based on the results.
