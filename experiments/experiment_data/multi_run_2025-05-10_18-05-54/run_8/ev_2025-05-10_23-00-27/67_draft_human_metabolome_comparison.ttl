# Predicted Query
# ==============
# https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql
# This query is a draft and may not be fully executable due to the complexity of defining and querying the entire human metabolome across federated SPARQL endpoints.
# It provides a starting point by querying UniProt for proteins associated with human and potentially involved in metabolic processes.
# Further refinement and integration with other metabolome-specific databases (e.g., HMDB, ChEBI via Rhea) would be necessary for a comprehensive result.

  # Potentially federate with Rhea or other databases to retrieve associated metabolites and reactions.
  # This would require additional SERVICE clauses and property paths to link proteins to metabolites and reactions.
  # Example (Illustrative and may require adjustments based on actual schema):
  # SERVICE <https://sparql.rhea-db.org/sparql> {
  #   ?reaction rhea:enzyme ?protein .
  #   ?reaction rhea:reactant ?metabolite .
  #   ?metabolite rdfs:label ?metaboliteName .
