  # Step 1: Use ALLIE to find chemical entities with both Japanese and English labels.
  # The 'starting in Japanese' is interpreted as having a label in the Japanese language.
  SERVICE <https://data.allie.dbcls.jp/sparql> {
    ?chemical rdfs:label ?japaneseLabel .
    FILTER (lang(?japaneseLabel) = "ja") # Filter for Japanese labels

    ?chemical rdfs:label ?englishLabel .
    FILTER (lang(?englishLabel) = "en")   # Filter for English labels (the translation)
  }

  # Step 2: Ensure the found ?chemical entity is known and has a label in Rhea-DB.
  # This also serves as the join point for the federated query, ensuring ?chemical is processed by the host.
  # Rhea-DB typically uses CHEBI URIs for compounds and provides rdfs:label for them.
  ?chemical rdfs:label ?rheaChemicalLabel .
  # We don't need to select ?rheaChemicalLabel as the primary goal is the translation from ALLIE.
