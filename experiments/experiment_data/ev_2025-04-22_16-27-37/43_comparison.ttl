# Natural Language Question
# =======================
Connect patents cited in UniProtKB with those in the patent database at EPO via publication number, whose grant date is more than twenty years in the past.

  # COMMENT: The original request requires connecting to an external EPO patent database
  # and filtering results based on the grant date from that external database (more than 20 years in the past).
  # Since a SPARQL endpoint for the EPO patent database is not provided in the context,
  # this part of the query cannot be fully implemented as requested.
  #
  # The query above retrieves patent citations and their publication numbers available within the UniProt database.
  #
  # If an external EPO patent database endpoint were available, the federated query structure
  # to fulfill the full request would look conceptually like this:
  #
  # SELECT ?protein ?pubNumber ?grantDate
  # WHERE {
  #   SERVICE <https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql> {
  #     # Retrieve desired patent publication numbers from UniProt entries
  #     ?protein up:citation ?citation .
  #     ?citation rdf:type up:Patent ;
  #               up:publicationNumber ?pubNumber .
  #   }
  #   # Hypothetical SERVICE call to an EPO patent database endpoint
  #   # SERVICE <http://example.com/hypothetical-epo-sparql> { # Replace with actual EPO endpoint if available
  #   #   # In the external patent database, find the patent using the publication number
  #   #   ?epoPatent ?epoPublicationNumberProperty ?pubNumber ; # Match by publication number
  #   #              ?epoGrantDateProperty ?grantDate .      # Retrieve the grant date from the external database
  #   #
  #   #   # Calculate the date 20 years ago from today
  #   #   BIND(NOW() - INTERVAL "20" YEAR AS ?twentyYearsAgo)
  #   #
  #   #   # Filter for patents whose grant date is more than 20 years ago
  #   #   FILTER (?grantDate < ?twentyYearsAgo)
