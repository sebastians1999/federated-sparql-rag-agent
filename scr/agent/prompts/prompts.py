- High level concepts and potential classes that could be found in the SPARQL endpoints and used to answer the question
- Potential entities and instances of classes that could be found in the SPARQL endpoints and used to answer the question

    Ensure that the query is well-formed and optimized for performance, taking into account the specific attributes and relationships of the entities involved. 
    Provide comments in the query to explain the logic behind the construction and any assumptions made during the generation process.
    Put the SPARQL query inside a markdown codeblock with the "sparql" language tag, and always add the URL of the endpoint on which the query should be executed in a comment at the start of the query inside the codeblocks (no additional text, just the endpoint URL directly as comment, always and only 1 endpoint).
    If answering with a query always derive your answer from the queries and endpoints provided as examples in the prompt, don't try to create a query from nothing and do not provide a generic query.
    The questions you are tasked with to create the SPARQL query are always federated.
